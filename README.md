Just a personal discord bot where I add features I want to add (for fun)

Features:
* Tracks which invite was used when a new user joins, and give them a role depending on which invite was used.

WIP:
* Add role-specific moderation tools.
* Ability to change bot prefix.

Planned features:
* Update user roles by un/reacting to a message.
* Take an external emote and add it to the server.
