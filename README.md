Just a personal discord bot where I add features I want to add (for fun)

Features:
* Tracks which invite was used when a new user joins, and give them a role depending on which invite was used.

WIP:
* Implement the list feature for inviteroles.
* Add role-specific moderation tools.

Planned features:
* Give user a role by reacting to a message.
